		<h3><a name="Size" id="Size">1. Changing  the size of Dataplotter</a></h3>
		<p>
            To vary the size of Dataplotter, first click  on the webpage outside Dataplotter or press F5 to reload Dataplotter. 
            Then hold  down the Ctrl key and either rotate the mouse wheel or press the + or - keys.  This zooms the entire webpage 
            in and out. To reset the page to its default  size, click on the webpage outside Dataplotter or reload Dataplotter by 
            pressing the F5 key, and then press Ctrl+0 (that is, press the Ctrl and 0 keys  together).
      	If necessary, use the vertical and horizontal scroll bars to move around the   enlarged webpage.</p>

		<h3><a name="KeyboardControl" id="KeyboardControl">2. Keyboard control</a></h3>
		<p>
        	All of the Dataplotter components can be controlled by using the keyboard as an alternative to the mouse. To begin, 
            you have to select Dataplotter, which you can do by clicking inside it.  An alternative, which works in some browsers, 
            is to repeatedly press the Tab key (this is called <em>tabbing</em>) until a component of Dataplotter is highlighted by a 
            border around it.   	  </p>
<p>
			A border like this around a Dataplotter component indicates that the component has <em>keyboard focus</em> (or <em>focus</em> for short). 
            When a component has focus, you can control it with the keyboard.  You can give a component focus in the following ways 
            (some methods work for only some components).      	</p>
<ul>
			<li>Click  on the component (e.g. an input box). </li>
	        <li>Use the shortcut keys given in the next section.</li>
          	<li>
            	Tab through the components (repeatedly press the Tab key).  Each time you press the Tab key the focus is transferred 
                to the next component in order. You can tab backwards by pressing the Tab key while holding down the Shift key 
                (Shift+Tab). 
            </li>
      	</ul>
		<p>
        	When a component has focus, keyboard commands are available. 
      </p>
		<ul>
          	<li>
            	When one of the tabs (e.g. Dotplot, Boxplot) has focus, pressing the Space key activates that tab.            </li>
          	<li>
            	When a button has focus, pressing the Space key presses the button.            </li>
          	<li>
            	When an input box has focus, you can type characters into it. You must press the Enter key (while the box has focus) 
                or change focus to another component for the change to take effect.            </li>
          	<li>
            	When a drop-down selector for choosing a dataset has focus, pressing the Space bar opens the drop-down list. Use the 
                Up and Down arrow keys to navigate the list and then press the Enter key to choose the highlighted option. The Home 
                and End keys take you to the first and last datasets in the list.            </li>
        </ul>
	    <p>To reload Dataplotter, make sure that the focus is  on the web page and press the F5 key.</p>

		<h3><a name="ShortcutKeys" id="ShortcutKeys">3. Shortcut keys</a></h3>
		<p>
			Some components have shortcut keys which, when pressed with the Ctrl and Alt keys held down, allow you to shift the focus 
            directly to these components.  To use the shortcut keys, you must have the focus on a Graphplotter component.
	  </p>
        <p>
	        Some components have a letter or number underlined to remind you of their shortcut keys. You can choose to display shortcut 
            reminders for some other components &ndash; Section 18 tells you how to do this.

        	Click the Scatterplot tab (or the keyboard alternative) to display a scatterplot of the datasets. The left- and right-hand 
            datasets are used for the x- and y-coordinates, respectively. A point is plotted for each row that contains numbers in 
            both datasets. 
      </p>
		<p>		  
            It is appropriate to display a scatterplot only if the selected datasets contain paired data.

		<p>		  
        	If you tick the Regression checkbox, then a regression line calculated using the least squares method is shown on the graph. 
            The equation of the line and the correlation coefficient of the data are shown above the graph. The numbers in the regression 
            equation are displayed to 5 significant figures and the correlation coefficient is displayed to 5 decimal places. To remove 
            the regression line, untick the checkbox.

		<h3><a name="View" id="View">16. Choosing the viewable area of the scatterplot</a></h3>
		<p>
        	You can change the viewable area of the scatterplot in any of the following ways.
      </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            	Type new  numbers in the x min, x max, y min and y max boxes at the bottom right of the right-hand  panel, and press 
            	the Enter key or select another component. 
            </li>
            <li>
            	Use the arrow,  zoom and &lsquo;Autoscale&rsquo; buttons under the graph. 
            </li>
            <li>
            	Move the graph  with the mouse, by left-clicking on the graph and keeping the mouse button  pressed while you move the 
            	mouse to drag the graph in the required direction.  Release the mouse button to leave the graph in place. 
            </li>
            <li>
            	Zoom in and  out with the mouse, by clicking on the graph and rotating the mouse wheel.
          </li>
            <li>
            	Move the graph  by using the keyboard. First, make sure that the graph has focus (indicated by a  yellow box). To do this, 
	            you can move the mouse pointer over the graph, tab to  the graph or press Crtl+Alt+0.&nbsp; Then you  can move the graph 
    	        slowly by holding down the Shift key and pressing the Home  and End keys for left and right, or the Page Up and Page Down 
        	    keys for up and  down. You can move it faster by also holding down the Ctrl key. 
            </li>
            <li>
            	Zoom in and  out by using the keyboard.&nbsp; To zoom in, make  sure that the graph has focus and press the Insert key 
                or the + key. To zoom out,  press the Delete key or the - key. The + and - keys on the numeric keypad can  also be used. 
            </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
			If there are no points displayed on the scatterplot, this may be because there are no points within the viewable area. To 
            display the points, click on the &lsquo;Autoscale&rsquo; button. This resets the viewable area of the graph to display all the points.

		<h3><a name="PlottingPoints" id="PlottingPoints">17. Plotting  and deleting scatterplot points</a></h3>
  		<p>
        	If you have two different datasets selected in the left and right columns, both of which are user-created, then points can be 
            created, moved and deleted on the graph.  This allows you to experiment with made-up datasets.
        </p>
		<p>		  
        	You can plot a point by entering its coordinates in the data columns. The cell number must be the same in both columns. You 
            can delete a point by deleting its coordinates from the data columns.  You can also change points in the following ways.
        </p>
        <br />
        <strong>Using the cursor boxes</strong>
		<p>		  
        	To plot a point, enter its x- and y-coordinates in the cursor boxes below the scatterplot, give the graph focus by pressing 
            Ctrl+Alt+0, and then press the Space key.  To delete a point, enter its coordinates, give the graph focus and press the Space 
            key.
        </p>
        <br />
        <strong>Using the crosshair</strong>        
		<p>		  
        	When you move the mouse pointer over a scatterplot, it changes to a crosshair.
        </p>
		<p>		  
        	You can plot a point by holding down the Shift key and clicking on the graph at the position where you want the point to be. 
            The coordinates are entered into the dataset columns. 
        </p>
		<p>		  
        	When you move the crosshair over a point, it is highlighted and its coordinates are displayed. If you hold down the Shift key 
            and click on a point, then it is deleted and its coordinates are removed from the dataset columns. 
      	</p>
		<p>		  
        	To drag a point to a new position, position the crosshair over the point so that it is highlighted. Then hold down the Shift 
            key, click on the point and keep the left mouse button pressed while you drag the point to a new position. Release the mouse 
            button at the new position. The dataset values are updated accordingly. 
      	</p>
		<p>		  
        	You can move the crosshair by using the keyboard. First make sure that the graph has focus (indicated by a yellow box). Then 
            you can move the crosshair slowly left and right by using the Home and End keys, or up and down by using the Page Up and Page 
            Down keys. You can move the crosshair faster by also holding down the Ctrl key.  Alternatively, you can move the crosshair by 
            switching on Num Lock on your keyboard and using the arrow keys on the numeric keypad.  
      	</p>
        <br />
        <strong>Changing points can cause loss of data</strong>        
		<p>		  
        	The data are tidied up every time you use the cursor boxes or crosshair to plot, move or delete a point on the graph. This 
            means that any non-numerical data are deleted, and all data values are moved up, if necessary, so that there are no blank 
            cells amongst the data values. It also means that if the two datasets have different numbers of values, then the unpaired 
            values are deleted. This can cause you to lose data from a dataset that you have created, so if you want to manipulate a 
            dataset using the Scatterplot page then it is a good idea to make a copy of it first.  You can do this by changing its name 
            (see Section 6).
